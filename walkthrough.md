# Cayman Verifiable Trust Protocol Upgrade - Walkthrough

## Overview
This document demonstrates the upgrade of the Legacy Prototype to a W3C-compliant Digital Identity Network.

## 1. The Credential Engine (Module 1)
We have replaced generic JWTs with W3C Verifiable Credentials (JSON-LD).

### Schema
The `credential-schema.jsonld` defines the Cayman Investor Credential context.

### Verification
The `vc-service.js` module issues and verifies these credentials.

**Code Snippet (Issuance):**
```javascript
const token = vcService.issueCredential(subjectDid, claims);
```

**Verification Output:**
```
✓ Credential Verified Successfully
  Issuer: did:web:example-bank.com
  Subject: did:key:z6Mkq...
```

## 2. The Sharded Vault 2.0 (Module 2)
The Vault now includes RFC 3161 Timestamping and ISO 30107-3 Liveness metadata in the encrypted blob.

**Decrypted Entry Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "tin": "123-456",
  "_security_metadata": {
    "liveness_verified": true,
    "liveness_standard": "ISO 30107-3",
    "timestamp_seal": {
      "authority": "Cayman TSA",
      "timestamp": "2025-11-27T22:18:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. The Reliance Monitor (Module 3)
The `reliance-monitor.js` bot performs active spot checks.

**Scenario: Bank Offline (Reliance Breach)**
When the Bank Node is unreachable (simulated), the monitor detects the breach and attempts revocation.

**Log Output:**
```
[RELIANCE MONITOR] Spot checking Transaction ID: test_tx_001...
[RELIANCE MONITOR] ✗ FAILED test_tx_001: Error
[RELIANCE MONITOR] ⚠️ RELIANCE BREACH DETECTED for test_tx_001
[RELIANCE MONITOR] Revoking credential...
```

## 4. Interoperability Bridge (Module 4)
The `updated-server.js` exposes OIDC endpoints.

**Discovery Endpoint:** `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration`
**Token Exchange:** `POST /v1/token` (RFC 8693)

## Conclusion
The system is now upgraded to meet the Cayman Verifiable Trust Protocol requirements.
